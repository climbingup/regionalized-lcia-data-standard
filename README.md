# Regionalized LCIA data standard

This repository gives a technical interchange format for data and metadata when providing regionalized (i.e. site-dependent) characterization factors for life cycle assessment. It was developed as part of the [UNEP-SETAC life cycle initiative](https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/) task force on framework and cross-cutting issues working group on regionalized life cycle impact assessment, chaired by [Chris Mutel](https://chris.mutel.org/) and co-chaired by Xun Liao and Laure Patouillard.
