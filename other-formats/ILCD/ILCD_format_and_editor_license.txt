**********
Preceding, not legally binding explanations:
These license conditions guarantee to everybody a free access to and use of 
the ILCD Format and ILCD Editor in LCA studies, for documenting own data sets, 
for implementation into software or deriving such, etc. They help to avoid 
misuse such as selling these cost free tools or misusing them in inappropriate 
advertisements for derived software or data sets or studies. They hence 
guarantee to you as user of the ILCD Format, Editor or derived tools, or of 
ILCD-formatted data sets that you are properly informed what you get under 
the name "ILCD". At the same time the license conditions protect the related 
interests of the European Commission and development partners. They also ask 
that proper reference is made when the source code of the ILCD Format or 
Editor is used for other tools. Follows below the legally binding license text.

SCOPE
This license refers to the ILCD Format and the ILCD Editor 
(both also referred to as "software"), developed by the European 
Commission, Directorate-General Joint Research Centre, Institute for 
Environment and Sustainability (JRC-IES), European Platform on Life 
Cycle Assessment (EP-LCA) in Italy together with the Karlsruhe Institut of Technology 
(KIT), Institut fuer Angewandte Informatik (IAI) in Germany.

Redistribution, use and modification of the ILCD Format and of the ILCD 
Editor in source and executable form is permitted, provided that all 
the following conditions are met that refer to the respective activity. 
These conditions also analogously apply to the redistribution, use and 
modification of previously redistributed or modified variants of the ILCD 
Format and of the Editor:

* Redistribution of modified or unmodified source code must retain the above 
  copyright notice and this license text.

* Redistribution of modified or unmodified executables must reproduce the 
  above copyright notice and this license text in the documentation and/or 
  other materials provided with the redistribution.

* Modified versions of the software may be developed without limitations and 
  distributed commercially or non-commercially. The original or only 
  insignificantly modified versions of this software may however only be 
  (re)distributed free of charge, license fee, or similar. In case of 
  development of modified versions, reference must also be given in a clearly 
  visible form and place to the work of the developers of the original software 
  as follows: "This product includes portions of the ILCD Format and/or 
  the ILCD Editor, created by the European Commmission's JRC-IES, European 
  Platform on Life Cycle Assessment together with the KIT, IAI. Copyright 
  (C) 2011, European Commission. All Rights Reserved." 

* Neither the name "ILCD", nor that of any of the above named developers
  of the software nor any name derivations or otherwise confusingly similar 
  expressions may however be used to endorse or promote products derived from 
  this software without specific prior written permission (see also (1), (2)). 


The following paragraph applies to newly created data sets 
and their relation to the ILCD Format:

* The creator and/or distributor of newly created ILCD-formatted process data sets 
  must strictly avoid to give the impression, that the data set is endorsed by the 
  European Commission or its bodies or that it meets certain qualty criteria other 
  than being ILCD-formatted, unless this is explicitely permitted by JRC-IES, based 
  on yet to be developed requirements. If the newly developed, ILCD-formatted process 
  data set meets the requirements set forth in the "ILCD Data Network - entry-level 
  requirements" or one of the "ILCD compliance" variants as specified in the 
  document "ILCD Data Network - Compliance rules and entry-level requirements" 
  (accessible via http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu, it may be promoted as being 
  compliant to the respective requirements.

Furthermore the "Important legal notice" of the European Commission as 
presently found at http://www.europa.eu/geninfo/legal_notices_en.htm fully 
applies. In case of contradictions with this license text or unclarities 
that "Important legal notice" is binding, rendering invalid any possibly 
deviating conditions set forth in this license, while the not affected 
conditions still apply.


---------------
(1) The use of the name "ILCD-formatted" will usually be granted upon request if the 
    derived product is fully compatible with the original ILCD schema files, e.g. if 
    being a software it imports and expeorts valid ILCD formatted data sets. 
    This condition is also fulfilled if - as foreseen in the ILCD Format - additional namespaces 
    are defined and used together with the ILCD namespace, creating an extended ILCD Format variant, 
    that still provides ILCD valid data sets. Moreover, files created with a derived version shall be 
    importable into, editible, and exported from the ILCD Editor.
(2) Format conversion between the ILCD Format and another data set format may only be 
    promoted as offering a conversion function in reference to or from the ILCD Format 
    if they meet at least one of the following two sets of conditions in ADDITION to 
    the ones laid out in (1) above: 
   -(I) all information is transferred without loss of information AND is assigned in 
    the receiving format to the semantically appropriate format fields in the technically correct way, 
    i.e. meeting the field content definitions, field types, enumerated entries (if any), etc. with the not accordingly 
    assignable information being kept togehter with the resulting data set in fields of a separate namespace or 
    by another mechanism foreseen by the receiving format (or as a separate document if such should not be foreseen) OR 
   -(II) the conversio software is meeting the above conditions of (2)(I) for at least all the 
    data set inventory information ("Inputs and Outputs") plus for half of all mappable or convertable 
    information items/fields AND is generating a case-specific and detailed list for the user of not 
    or only partly convertable information and not sufficiently matching field or object 
    assignments. In case only set (2)(II) is met, the promotion has to inform the potential 
    user about the limited convertion functionality by using clear formulations such 
    as "partly converts to/from the ILCD Format" and the intended reference 
    has to be in principle confirmed by EC's JRC-IES, EPLCA beforehand and in written form.
